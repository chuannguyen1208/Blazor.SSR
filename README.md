# Blazor.SSR Rich Text Editor with Quilljs

I'm trying to learn Blazor new version in .NET 8 which has static server side rendering and also @rendermode. 
I intended to build a blog site for myself, in order to archive it, I have to have a page which has rich text editor.
Eventually, I find out Quilljs

Quilljs version using in this sample is 1.0.0 cause 1.3.6 having an issue related to js deprecated functions. I have to rollback to previous version to wait for version 2.0
